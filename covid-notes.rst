Sept 23, 2020
=============

As of today, the United States has had 6.95 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 202 thousand deaths.  That's a plenty grim milestone.  It's also worth noting that the US is now worse on a per capita death rate has now passed Sweden, and we currently rank 11th worst in the world on this metric.  (Well, out of those countries which report at least, and there's a number that don't.)

Looking ahead a bit, the city of Manaus, Brazil `may be showing us <https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/22/1008709/brazil-manaus-covid-coronavirus-herd-immunity-pandemic/>_` what things would look like if this continues to burn through the population.  There's reason to believe that they have actually reached (or at least nearly reached) herd immunity.  In the process, roughly 1 in 500 people have died.  This is about 3x worse than where the US stands today. The estimated IFR is around 0.3%.  

If that matched our experience, we'd expect to see somewhere around 600-800k deaths here in the US.  However, even assuming Manaus actually has reached herd immunity, it's important to note the US experience may be much worse.  Manaus is a fairly young city overall with less than 6% of the population over 60.  That same number for the US is roughly 20%.  Given we know the risk on this increases greatly with age, that gives us strong reason to suspect the death rate would be higher here.

I remain interested in trying to understand such worse case scenarios as I remain very skeptical that we're going to have an effective vaccine any time soon.  The Russians have been caught manufacturing data on their vaccine and the US vaccine studies are coming under seriously problematic political preassure.  I remain skeptical that we're going to have an effective vaccine in wide deployment any time in the next six months, and maybe not for a full year or more.

If projections above (and similiar ones I've given before based on estimated IFRs) turn out to be right, we're looking at increasing the death rate for the year by ~25%.  That's bad, but it's also not catestrophic.  Nearly 3 million people die each and every year.  Most years, we - as a society - never really notice unless one of those deaths strikes close to home.  

Sept 1, 2020
============

As of today, the USA has had 6.08 million confirmed cases, and 184 thousand confirmedc cases.  Subtracting out the counts from two weeks ago, that's 700 thousand new cases, and 15 thousand new deaths.  That gives us roughly 1.3m new cases in the month of August and 27k confirmed deaths for the same.  

For context, if we assume the 3-10x estimate for number of actual cases vs confirmed cases still holds, this would imply that there has been somewhere around 20 and 60 million cases in the US to date.  That's potentially as much as 20% of the population. There's reason to be a bit skeptical of that since the most recent antibody study results I've seen aren't anywhere near that high, but something in the 5% range seems fairly plausible.  So, "only", 1 in 20 people in the US.  

The other bit of context is that the raw CFR over the last month has been around 2% and the cummulative CFR for the whole period has trended down to ~3%.  As before, if we assume only some fraction of cases are getting caught, that puts IFR somewhere in the 0.2-1% range.  There are much fancier estimations out there; I find doing back of the envelope numbers like this to be useful in keeping context though.

The major thing I'm tracking virus wise is that we've now had our first two confirmed cases of reinfection.  The fact we're seeing cases isn't suprising; with over 6 million cases in the US alone, it would be surprisig if we didn't!  It's clear from the two cases which happen to be documented, and our relatively poor testing situation, that there are probably many more cases out there.  On the other hand, this doesn't seem to be widespread just yet.  The real question is what the population level immunity drop off looks like; that'll be a big factor in reducing spread rate w/ or w/o a vaccine.  So far, I don't see any strong reason to worry just yet.

Aug 16, 2020
=============

As of today, the United States has had 5.37 million confirmed cases, and 169 thousand deaths.  That's roughly 600k new cases, and 12k deaths in the last two weeks.  This continues to be right in line with my projections from July 19th.  

There are some tentative signs of good news developing in the last two weeks.

First, SalivaDirect, a new inexpensive COVID saliva based test developed by Yale on a not for profit basis, has received `emergency approval by the FDA <https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/15/yales-rapid-covid-19-saliva-test-receives-fda-emergency-use-authorization>`_.  This is a really big deal as the supplies to run the test cost under $3 and the testing protocol is public and could conceivable be scaled very widely.  If we can get to the point where it's reasonable to test everyone - and I mean *everyone* - every couple of days, we can realistically control this thing and go back to a much more usual existance.

Second, a monoclonal antibody therapy from Eli Lilly `entered third stage testing <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-03/eli-lilly-s-virus-antibody-drug-starts-testing-in-nursing-homes?sref=WRJrJ8H7>`_.  Initial results look promising, and the `science behind such an approach <https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/11/antibody-drugs-could-be-one-of-the-best-weapons-against-covid-19-but-will-they-matter/>`_ is fairly well understood.  If we can identify a treatment which meaningfully decreases mortaility and scale it appropriately, that could be a game changer.  One concerning sign is that I haven't seen much on plans to scale production; Operation Warp Speed which is funding vaccine production efforts doesn't seem to be funding treatments.  I hope I've simply missed a headline here.

Third, Sweden - which has been following a fairly open strategy all along - appears to be seeing both `new cases  <https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/sweden?country=~SWE>`_ and `death rates <https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?yScale=log&zoomToSelection=true&minPopulationFilter=1000000&country=~SWE&deathsMetric=true&interval=smoothed&aligned=true&hideControls=true&smoothing=7&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc>`_ drop sharply in recent weeks.  This is encouraging as it gives us an idea of what a mostly out of control spread scenario looks like, and it's lot less bad than it could have been.  Now, Sweden's *total* per capital death rate is still a lot higher than it's neighboors and it's population has a lot lower risk profile than the United States, but still, this is encouraging to see.  Do note that just because Sweden hasn't had formal shutdowns doesn't mean that individual behavior hasn't radically changed; I'd read this more as a hint as to what spread looks like in a health population practicing social distancing measures than anything else.

Fourth, preliminary reports on a treatment called `RLF-100 appear to be very promising <https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-relief-hldg-neuror/relief-neurorx-say-emergency-treatment-with-rlf-100-helps-critically-ill-covid-patients-idUSKBN24Y0OR>`_.  It's important to note that these are very early results, and I haven't see enough on this to know how real this is just yet.  If it works out as a treatment for several COVID cases, this could again be a game changer.  Interestingly, production would not need to be scaled anywhere near as much as a vaccine since you only need to treat the folks who develop severe cases.  In the United States, that would mean 50-100k doses a month at current rates.    

Aug 2, 2020
============

This will be a very short update as nothing major has changed in the last two weeks.  The USA is at 157k deaths with 4.71 million confirmed cases.  That's 13k confirmed deaths in the last two weeks, which unfortunately puts us right on track from my projections last time.  As before, there's some evidence that CFR is trending slightly lower, but the data is noisy enough to be hard to interpret.  

I'd really like to see someone perform an analysis of CFRs for individual {two week periods x locales} and then plot the computed estimates against test positivity rate.  I suspect from the data I've looked at that the national CFRs are being driven quite a bit higher than reality by high positivity rates (and thus low estimations of total confirmed cases).  Unfortunately, no data I've seen would imply an IFR much below 1/2% at the absolute best.  

I'll close by pointing to a nicely written `article by fivethirtyeight <https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-decision-is-a-risk-every-risk-is-a-decision/>`_ which has the best description of the calculated risk decisions each of us are making day by day I've seen so far.  The only thing I fault the article for is failing to acknowledge that this is the same decision procedure we have always applied - consciously or not - all that has changed is the (estimated) risks.

Immunity Duration
------------------

The big question being discussed this week was whether COVID-19 provides any form of extended immunity.  Such immunity is a key part of any herd immunity strategy - whether infection or vaccine based.  The best description I've seen so far is from `ArsTechnica <https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/beyond-antibodies-the-immune-response-to-coronavirus-is-complicated/>`_.  The summary appears to be "it's complicated", but there's no particular reason to panic just yet.  

One weirdly positive bit of news buried in the discussion of antibodies vs t-cell immunity is that our current surveillance testing only detects antibodies.  If - and this is a big if - it turns out than many people loose antibodies quickly, but retain at least some partial immunity via other mechanisms (t-cells?), then our estimates of the number of people infected so far may turn out to be low.  That would be good news for IFR if true.   I want to emphasize that we just don't know, and shouldn't place much hope in this. 

Death Rates Trending Down
-------------------------

One apparent bit of very good bit of news, buried in all the bad news, is that death rates definitely appear to be trending down.  As of today, there have been 143k deaths out of 3.83m confirmed cases.  This a CFR under 4%.  

If we look at only the cases and deaths since June 12th, we've got 27k additional deaths and 1.73m additional confirmed cases.  That would give a lower bound on CFR of around 1.5%.  It's a lower bound as deaths are a lagging indicator, and it's hard to say how much the additional death number would increase from currently active cases.

If we take the deaths as of today and the cases as of July 2nd (to try to adjust for the lag in deaths), we'd be looking at 27k additional deaths and 640k additional cases.  That would have our CFR back at something around 4%.

**Conclusion?**  It's really too early to say what's going on with CFR.  It might actual be trending down, or we might be fooling ourselves by combining metrics with different lags.  It's impossible to say.

Big Picture
-----------

I don't want to be alarmist, but the current situation in the USA is distincly "not good".  We appear to be following a path of barely controlled burn through.  As bad as things currently are, the fact we're seeing shutdowns again mean things aren't fully uncontrolled either.  For reference, fully uncontrolled burn through screnarios are the ones which completely swamp hospital capacity and we see CFRs north of 20%.  We're not seeing that, and I doubt we will for any sustained period.  

My current personal best guess is that IFR will end up someone around 1/5th of the current estimated CFR.  (So, around 1%.)  I expect we'll continue to see US states relax and then tighten restrictions with the effect of keeping R somewhere close to 1.  Given this, I am expecting to see a slowly increasing number of deaths for each month until we have an effective vaccine.  As a ballpark, let's say around 20k increasing up to around 50k per month, or around 150-300k over the next 6 months. At some point we'll start seeing R drop due to partial herd immunity, but practically, I suspect we're going to be hovering around R~=1 for the forseable future.  

I really hope I'm wrong; these are pretty terrible numbers.  But on the other hand, it is important to keep perspective.  Somewhere around 2.4m people died (of all causes) in 2019.  If we project 600k from COVID, 2020/2021's death rates will definitely be well above average, but they're not going to catestrophic either.

The virus
----------

As of today, the United States has had 130 thousand deaths out of 2.74 million confirmed cases.  This gives us an estimated CFR of ~5%, which is in line with the 6% estimate from a few weeks ago.

This week, the `CDC <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html>`_ reported results from antibody studies which seemed to show actual case rates were more than 10x higher than confirmed cases.  I'd honestly love to believe this is true, because if it is, it means the IFR is somewhere around 0.5%.  However, I think there are some reasons to be cautious here. 

* First, and I hate saying this, the CDC has come under a lot of political pressure.  That may be biasing the results.  
* Second, the absolute infection rates in most of the regions studied is low.  From the linked to paper, the false positive rate on the test used was just under 1%.  That would seem to put the results out of the range of likely error, but it does mean the claimed ratios are potentially too high.  In particular, the highest claimed ratios appear to be from the lowest absolute percentages (and thus most influenced by false positives.)  
* Third, and this is the biggest one, the data is old.  The most recent reported result is from May 2nd.  For a result published almost 60 days later, that is flat out suspicious.  

Putting it all together, I'd be willing to say that case rates are at least 4-5x higher than confirmed via testing based on these results, but I wouldn't go beyond that.  (As much as I'd like to.)

Treatments
-----------

A couple weeks back, we learned that `dexamethasone <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01824-5>`_, a common steroid, appears to reduce death rates in severly ill covid patients by about 20%.  This is wonderful news, both because it would reduce our observed CFR, and also because this is a generic medication which is already widely available and *cheap* (less than $8 per dose).  That is by far the best news we've gotten to date.

This week, we're seeing efforts to `scale the collection and distribution <https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-seeks-large-scale-expansion-of-blood-plasma-collection-for-covid-19-11593691200>`_ of blood plasma from recovered covid patients.  As mentioned previously, we have good reason to believe that such a strategy works, and can help reduce the severity for many patients.

Putting these two together, that's a dang good bit of news.  I expect we'll start seeing the CFR trending downward over the next few months.  There's some hope we're already seeing that in the national data, but there's also a bunch of other interpretations possible there.  

I will note that I remain sceptical of the possibility of a widely deployed vaccine within the next 12 months.  I suspect we will see one, but almost certainly not this year, and next year is a merely a hope.  In theory, timelines could be accelerated with good planning and coordination, but we haven't exactly seen much evidence of that recently.  


June 12, 2020
==============

On the topic of antibody studies, we do have one small update from NY State `in minority cummuniy churches <https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-results-states-antibody-testing-survey>'_.  I am increasing nervous at the fact the state of NY has not been publishing updates to their antibody study.  

Despite the relatively scarcity of new data, it seems like there is an emerging consensus that the infection fatility rate for COVID-19 is somewhere slightly under 1%.  The case fatality rate on the other hand seems to be hovering right around 6% for all of the data sets we have.  At the national level, we currently have 2.1 million confirmed cases, and 116 thousand deaths for a CFR of 5.5%.  As discussed previously, deaths are skewed very strongly towards the elderly, so what these numbers look like in each community is strongly dependent on demographics, but the rough numbers give us a rough idea of what we're looking at.  

One correction to the writeup below.  The study I referenced on hydroxychloroquine has been heavily critized and retracted.  Other studies are still supporting a fairly skeptical attidute here, but the study which initially appeared fairly conclusive turned out not to be.  

May 24, 2020
============

What do we know about the virus?
---------------------------------

The number of deaths per *confirmed case* is disturbingly high.  The NYC numbers [1]_ as of today are 195,452 cases, with 16,469 confirmed deaths and another 4,747 probable.  This works out to a more than 10% death rate, concentrated almost entirely in older adults [2]_.

Thankfully, there's a big difference between *confirmed cases* and *number of people infected*.  The best evidence we have to date is the new york antibody study [3]_ found 24.7% of the population to be positive for antibodies implying they had been previously infected.  With a population of 8.6 million that would mean actual case counts were around 2.1 million, ad that the death rate is actually closer 1%.  It does make me nervous that the last update on these numbers I can find is now three weeks old though.  

There is no evidence for reinfection at this time.  There were some initial reports from South Korea of potential reinfection cases, but those have now been thoroughly disproven.  The cases in question were either false positive on tests, or individuals shedding *dead* virus.  From other viruses in the same family, we have every reason to expect a prolonged immutity period of at least a couple of years.  Neither point is confirmed yet, but we can be reasonable confident that if there wasn't a substaintial period of at least partial immunity that we'd have seen that by now.  

There is some evidence of lasting effects even in younger people.  However, all of the cases reported so far are in very small absolute numbers.  That might change, but at the moment, we have no reason to believe that any large fraction of the population has long term complications following recovery.  

I have focused on the NYC data - mostly because it's the largest sample size with the fewest known bias problems - but the same general picture appears everywhere else we have data as well.

Implications
-------------

One key statement is that for most of the US, containment has failed and is no longer a viable strategy.  This is definitely true in NYC; there's no possible way to contact trace 100s of thousands of cases.  This is not true for many other areas of the country which have much lower case counts which is one legitimate reason that responses will and should differ in different locations.

Given that, we're basically looking at having to let this burn through the general population.  The only good news is that a) the death rate seems to be about 1%, b) it appears to be heavily concentrated in older adults, and c) at least in NYC we appear to be at least a fourth of the way there.  Putting that in perspective, roughly 0.8% of the population dies from natural causes each year.  Given that, we're talking about an effective doubling of the annual death rate.  That's horrible, but it's also nowhere near a worst case scenario.  

Treatments
-----------

We strongly suspect that plasma treatments work [4]_.  They're hard to scale, but we have every reason to believe from history that the approach is workable and we have a number of studies which confirm this.

We know that remdesivir shortens recovery times [5]_.  It may also have a small effect on mortality, but that's unclear.  The important part is that by shortening recovery times by roughly 30%, our hospital capacity is effective increased by 40%.  That's huge because it helps us be a lot more confident we can avoid the hospital overload scenarios which could drive the death rates through the roof.

Despite what certain idiots might tell you, we know that hydroxychloroquine does not help [6]_ and actually appears to harm.  There's still room for further evidence here changing the picture, but at the moment, it looks like taking any of the drugs in this family is a damn bad idea.

I consider the odds of having an effective vaccine widely available before this has finished burning through the general population to be quite low.  I'd love to be suprised, but at the moment, I'm assuming this is a non-factor.  

A few weeks ago, there were reports [7]_ that survival rates for patients placed on mechanical ventalators were very low.  Unfortunately, the media badly misreported this study.  The reality is that more than 50% of the patients in the study were still in treatment (i.e. alive at the time of publication).  The scary numbers everyone (including me) saw were reporting the fraction of people who'd died out of those who'd either died or recovered at that point in time.  Until we have updated numbers - which oddly, I haven't seen yet - the results could be anywhere between a 60% recovery rate and a 90% death rate.  Really, we have no idea.
