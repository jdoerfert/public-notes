A collection of (public) notes on assorted topics.  If there's enough on a single topic, I've moved them into individual pages, otherwise individual notes are listed below. 

# A Line Crossed
Jan 7, 2021 - I write this today having witnessed yesterday armed insurrection in the nations capital.  Armed rioters, at the direct instigation of our sitting President, invaded the capital of our country, threatened the safety of our elected officials, and attempted to overthrow the results of a valid election. 

This **can not** be allowed to stand.

Every single person who participated in yesterday's shame upon our country must be identified, arrested, and placed on trial.  To do otherwise is to admit that we are no longer a democracy.  Some may be convicted of minor crimes.  Others should be charged with armed insurrection against the state, convicted, and spend their remaining years in prison.

I join many others in calling for the immediate removal of President Trump from office.  We must not wait until his term expires.  Congress should impeach immediately.  The Cabinet should exercise the 25th amendment.  This is not a question of which, it's a question of which can be concluded sooner.  He literally just attempted a coup.  Leaving him in office for the remainder of his term is dangerous in the extreme.

# 2020 Highlights
Dec 19, 2020 - With as overall terrible as this year has been, I wanted to highlight a few things which give me hope for the future.

SpaceX Starlink has entered widespread beta and appears to be delivering very reasonable latency (30ms) and bandwidth (100mbs down, 10s mbs up).  This is a massive technical accomplishment (antenna design, satalite launch and management, etc..) and could be worth changing.  Between this and the wide spread availability of solar power + battery backup + cheap generators, a lot of previously remote locations are about to enter the internet age.  That's wonderful for equity, but also has profound implications for society which are hard to predict.  

Between solar power and natural gas, the US is rapidly transitioning away from coal power.  We've reached the point that this is not a policy decision; it's an economic one.  Solar power and natural gas are just cheaper than coal.  Solar is now cheaper on a per MWh basis than any other generation source - by a noticable margin.  Even with the cost of natural gas plants to provide power in off times, or balance the grid, coal still can't compete.  Given how absolutely terrible coal is for air pollution (and thus public health), the environment, and the climate, this transition is a very good thing.  Better yet, because it's being driven by economics not policy, there's every reason to believe this will continue and, if anything, accelerate over the next few years.

Despite the headlines, the US election system worked.  Election day went smoothly, votes were counted and certified, and there was no actual disruption or ambiguity about the outcome.  We did have an outgoing president who tried to create drama and far too many republican politicians who supported him for far too long, but the system itself worked.  Leading into election day itself, it was not at all clear this was going to be the case (regardless of outcome).  

The development of vaccines for COVID has been an amazing scientific success.  Our previous record for vaccine development was 4 years; this time we did it in 10 months.  It's hard to understate how positive that is, both for the current pandemic, and for the future.  This won't be our last pandemic and the technology developed now (and over the last few decades) are going to be world changing going forward.
