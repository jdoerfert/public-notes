This is the draft form of my application to be on the LLVM foundation board.  If successful, the application becomes public, so I've decided simply to publish it from the beginning.  Current status is **very rough**.

Name (First and Surname) *
--------------------------
Philip Reames

Please summarize relevant contributions to the LLVM Project. These can include things such as patches, code ownership, bug reports, mailing list posts, blog posts, volunteering at LLVM events, organizing LLVM social events, contributing to the developer meeting paper committee, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LLVM contributor since 2013.  Major areas of (code) contribution:

* Main author of gc.statepoint infrastructure, and current defacto code owner of garbage collection support in LLVM
* Extensively contributed both directly and indirectly (though coworkers) to SCEV, IndVars, and much of our loop canonicalization infrastructure.  Recently became code owner.
* (Incrementally) rewrote most of LazyValueInfo and CorrelatedValuePropagation.

Non Technical Contributions

* Member of the recently established LLVM Security Group.
* Contact point for all Azul contributions to LLVM.  Representing LLVM internally (e.g. relicensing, etc..), and organizing organization contributions upstream, including internally focused developer education around LLVM community norms and processes.  
* Presenter at multiple LLVM Developer Conferences including one of the 2017 keynotes on the Falcon project.  Recently, most of my focus at developer meetings has been on the hallway track conversations, and the defacto frontends for dynamic languages sessions which happen each year (whether formally organized or not).  

TBD - How to describe Falcon, fuzzing efforts, etc..?

Why do you want to be on the LLVM Foundation board of directors?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I believe strongly that the LLVM project has become a core piece of infrastructure and investment is needing accordingly.  I personally greatly appreciate various aspects of the community (e.g. professionalism, creative tension between pragmatism and perfectionism, and a refusal to get lost in bike sheding), but also see stress points forming as the community scales (e.g. infrastructure, decision making, review fragmentation).  I want to ensure the project continues to scale without loosing the aspects which have made it such a wonderful ecosystem in which to work these last few years.  

What experience or skills can you bring to the board? Which of the above programs could you help drive forward?
-------------------------

We value diversity and representation of the various interested groups working on LLVM and using it. Do you consider yourself representative of a minority group, underrepresented geographic region, etc?

How many hours a week can you dedicate to LLVM Foundation business?

Are you willing and able to help fundraise for the LLVM Foundation? We rely on donations to fund our programs and need board members to help find new sponsors and donors.

Yes, with a paricular emphasis on trying to establish periodic giving campaigns and otherwise diversify the foundations funding.

Is there anything else you would like to add for the board to consider?
------------------------------------------------------------------
No.
